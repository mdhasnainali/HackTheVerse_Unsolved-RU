For example, if a vernier caliper output a measurement reading of 2.13 cm, this means that:\n\n    The main scale contributes the main number(s) and one decimal place to the reading (E.g. 2.1 cm, whereby 2 is the main number and 0.1 is the one decimal place number)\n    The vernier scale contributes the second decimal place to the reading (E.g. 0.03 cm)\n\ncaliper 1\n\nLet\u2019s examine the image of the vernier caliper readings above. We will just use a two steps method to get the measurement reading from this:\n\n    To obtain the main scale reading: Look at the image above, 2.1 cm is to the immediate left of the zero on the vernier scale. Hence, the main scale reading is 2.1 cm\n    To obtain the vernier scale reading: Look at the image above and look closely for an alignment of the scale lines of the main scale and vernier scale. In the image above, the aligned line correspond to 3. Hence, the vernier scale reading is 0.03 cm.\n\nIn order to obtain the final measurement reading, we will add the main scale reading and vernier scale reading together. This will give 2.1 cm + 0.03 cm = 2.13 cm.\nIn a nutshell\n\nUse the following formula:\n\nObtained reading=Main scale reading+Vernier scale reading","Uuid":"-1305703634"}]}]}}
