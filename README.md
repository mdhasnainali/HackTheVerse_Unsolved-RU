# Shikkha


The corona epidemic has taken a toll on the education sector in all countries of the world.Due to lack of adequate facilities,the amount of this loss is a little higher in our country.Although the government has taken many initiatives to offset this loss but the result have not been up to the mark.Various educational institutions are continuting their teaching programs through online classes to bring students back to study.But even though textbooks are taught through online classes,it is not possible  to teach the practical things that need to be taught hand-to-hand for which there is a lack of knowledge for students.

 

This problem needs to be solved before the problem gets bigger.As a solution of this problem,we have created an application named SHIKKHA , where teachers can show students all the task of a practical class in a very easy & attractive way,in addition to text books on any subjects in the online class.

 

The app has live class option through which the teachers can connect directly with the students.There will be recordings of live classes so that students can watch the classes again at any time when they need to.There will be slides on all subjects which will be helpful to the students.There is a question & answer box where students can freely clear their confusion by asking questions.Students will able to verify themselves in the assignment part.

 

There are some special features,which are  Circuit Simulator, Reaction Simulator, 3D View of Apparatus.

With these features,students will able to try out practicals through online animation class.
